Rather than move a piece on their turn, a player may choose instead to roll two special octahedral dice. Each die has four blank faces and four faces with a spider symbol. If the player rolls &ldquo;double spiders&rdquo;, i.e. both dice land with spiders on their uppermost faces, he or she may move one of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces (the &ldquo;turncoat&rdquo;) according to its usual movement value (turncoat Orcs treat both sides as hostile), capturing the opponent&rsquo;s pieces as though the turncoat piece was one of their own. The player may not, however, capture the Matron Mother with the turncoat piece, since Matron Mothers are too aware of treachery in their ranks to be caught unawares by such a gambit. The Matron Mother may be chosen as the turncoat, though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the player has moved the turncoat, play passes to his or her opponent again. The opponent may not immediately move the turncoat piece back to its previous position, although it can be moved to another position on this turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If any roll other than &ldquo;double spiders&rdquo; results, the player forfeits their move on that turn, and play passes back to their opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since there is only a one-in-four chance of rolling double spiders on the dice, many players avoid using them unless in dire need (for example, to move or capture a piece which has the Matron Mother in check). However, good players recognise that it is better to use the dice when a potential missed turn will not cost them too dearly, in the opening and middle game rather than in an all-or-nothing panic in the endgame. There are also more opportunities to cause havoc in the enemy ranks when there are more pieces on the board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no limit to when or how many times a player can throw the dice instead of making a move, but it is considered vulgar to resort to the dice before at least two moves have been made, and the height of crassness to simply roll the dice on every turn, hoping for a lucky break. The Drow may venerate Lolth&rsquo;s chaotic ways, but they know that the Spider Queen also helps those who help themselves, rather than relying on luck. A player who never rolls the dice may be regarded as somewhat irreverent, though, so it is thought to be good form to make at least one roll per game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Resurrection:</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>If an Orc manages to travel across the board to the opposite promotion zone (the block of nine spaces comprising the bulk of the opponent&rsquo;s starting position &ndash; for Red, A1, A2, A3, AB1, AB2, AB3, B1, B2, B3, for Blue, E1, E2, E3, EF1, EF2, EF3, F1, F2, F3), it may be removed from play and replaced with any piece which the opponent has captured. If none of the player&rsquo;s capital pieces have been taken, nothing happens. If, after the Orc has entered the opponent&rsquo;s base, a capital piece is captured, the Orc must move to another square within the base in order to enact the substitution.</p><p><b><br clear="all"> Strategy and tactics:</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Priestess is arguably the most powerful piece in the game (if placed correctly, it can attack over 40% of the board from a single space), but is hampered in the early stages of the game by the Orcs, which limit its ability to attack around the circumference of the board. For this reason, many players opt either to hold the Priestess in reserve until the later part of the game, when many of the Orcs have been captured, or sacrifice the outlying Orcs in order to make space for the Priestess to attack early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As in life, one must think several moves ahead with Wizards. Their range and jumping ability make them dangerous, but they have no way to attack at close quarters, and must be placed carefully to make maximum use of their talents. The Wizard is excellent for forking manoeuvres. About 70% of final captures in Sava are made by the Wizard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Weaponmaster is in its element when surrounded by adversaries, since this is the point at which its unique double-move is most effective. The Weaponmaster is often the first major piece to engage the enemy, and is often lost in the resulting skirmish. However, since the Weaponmaster can often take two pieces off the board in one move before being captured, the trade is usually worthwhile, especially if it results in the capture of the enemy Priestess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Matron Mother rarely has a chance to capture anything in the course of the game. Its low move rate make it very vulnerable, and it must be protected from attack by the more mobile pieces. The Matron Mother can easily be trapped by its own forces, so should be moved from its starting position as soon as possible &ndash; this manoeuvre is not easy since it necessitates the removal of at least two Orcs from the flanks, and can take as many as eight moves to complete. The threat of the enemy Wizard also prompts a player to open up space around the Matron Mother early in the game, to prevent it being blocked in by friendly pieces when the Wizard attacks. If the Wizard is captured during the opening then it can be an effective tactic to surround the Matron Mother with friendly pieces once again, making it harder for the remaining enemy forces to mount a successful attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Orcs are weak, and a canny opponent can use the special &ldquo;must move towards an enemy&rdquo; rule to dictate their movements and even paralyse them entirely. However, they are far more numerous than the other pieces, provide excellent defence, and can be used in conjunction with a Wizard or Weaponmaster to apply a lethal pincer check on the enemy Matron Mother. They can also exert considerable influence when they occupy at least two of the four central spaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The difficult feat of capturing a Matron Mother with an Orc is regarded as a very skilful play. Usually, it occurs due to a blunder by the opponent, at which point the winning player (and any observers) will taunt the loser, laugh at his ineptitude, and occasionally inflict light stab wounds.</p><b><br clear="all"></b><p><b>Notation:</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The board is divided into three ranks (1, 2 and 3) and four files (A-F, B-E, C-H and D-G). There are also eight &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; files (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG and GH). Individual spaces are referenced by their file and then rank, as shown below, except for the four centre spaces which are referred to by the two intersecting files (HA, BC, DE and FG:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="uai6" style="text-align:center"><img src="sava_files/File0007.jpg" style="height:254px;width:280px"></div><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pieces are referred to by the following abbreviations: </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matron Mother &ndash; M</p><p>Priestess &ndash; P</p><p>Wizard &ndash; Wz</p><p>Weaponmaster &ndash; Wm</p><p>Orc &ndash; no abbrev.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Movement is shown in the following format: (Piece)(Destination space), so that PFG3 indicates that the player moved their Priestess to space FG3. The exception to this is the Orc, which is noted as (Starting space)(Destination space), e.g. D3ED shows that the Orc on D3 was moved to ED. This avoids confusion if more than one Orc can move to the same space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Capture is shown by an x, so WzH2x denotes a Wizard moving to H2 and capturing the piece there. In the case of the Weaponmaster, a capture mid-move is shown by placing the x before the destination; so WmxAB2 indicates that the Weaponmaster moved to space AB2 and captured the piece it passed (assuming it started on A1, this would have been the piece on A2). A double capture is shown as WmxAB2x (&ldquo;Weaponmaster moved to square AB2, capturing the intervening piece and the piece at AB2&rdquo;).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An Orc entering the opponent&rsquo;s base and promoting, as per the resurrection rule (page 4), is indicated by the formula (Orc&rsquo;s move)(Resurrected piece), thus FG2F2Wm shows an Orc moving into the promotion zone and promoting to Weaponmaster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a player opts to roll the Spider Dice, this is shown as an asterisk. If a missed turn results, this is all that is entered in the notation, but if the player rolls double spiders and moves an opposing piece, this is entered after the asterisk, e.g. *D2D3x shows that the player rolled double spiders, moved his opponent&rsquo;s Orc from D2 to D3 and captured his opponent&rsquo;s piece at D3. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Sample Games in notation format:</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="Section2"><p><font size="2">1.

This makes it rather unwise to take the enemy Priestess except under very specific circumstances. This variation gained its name not because it was invented, or even played, by House Baenre, but because the denizens of Menzoberranzan associated the need to avoid aggravating a priestess quite closely with the First House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Ched Nased Sava</i> is a variant with a promotion, rather than a resurrection, rule &ndash; Orcs reaching the promotion zone can promote to capital pieces even if the player already has a piece of that type on the board, making it possible to have multiple Wizards, Weaponmasters or Priestesses in play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><img id="pndf" src="sava_files/File0008.jpg" style="float:left;height:74px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:1em;width:73px">Champion Sava</i>, a popular variant, adds an extra piece, the Holy Champion (C), which has the move ability of a Priestess and a Wizard combined. The Champion starts on the front line of the opening setup &ndash; AB3 for Blue and EF3 for Red. In spite of its substantial move tree, the Champion cannot capture or be captured, making it useful for blocking enemy attacks. In <i>Lolth&rsquo;s Champion Sava</i>, the Champion is allowed to make captures and be captured when the<img id="f9ta" src="sava_files/File0009.jpg" style="float:right;height:317px;margin-left:1em;margin-right:0px;width:282px"> other three capital pieces have been taken. This is the variant still played occasionally as a religious sacrament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Great Wheel Sava</i> is played on a larger board, with an extra file (24 spaces) around the circumference, Two extra Orcs are added, and each of the capital pieces is duplicated. An extra space, designated the Hub, appears in the centre of the board, and links the spaces HA, BC, DE and FG. The Hub is treated as a promotion zone for both sides. Great Wheel Sava is regarded as a novelty, and is not played seriously by very many drow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>Dice Sava</i>, a throw of one spider grants a player the usual turncoat move, whilst a throw of double spiders allows him to remove one of his opponent&rsquo;s pieces entirely.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>History:</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Sava&rsquo;s origins are mysterious. According to popular myth, it was gifted to the race of the Ilythiiri by the goddess Lolth, as a way of teaching them the tenets of drow society -&nbsp; treachery, fate, deviousness and careful planning. However, most historians of the game date its appearance to shortly after The Scattering, around -3000 DR, since there appears to be no evidence for its existence prior to this time. As the drow settled into a less expansionist and (comparatively!) more peaceful urban way of life, the increased leisure time of the nobility led to the development of sava as a pastime. Since it was, and still is, thought to teach many useful lessons about survival as a drow, the Matron Mothers of most clans gave their tacit approval to the game, and some even encouraged it amongst their subordinates. It was considered a vital part of the education of any warband leader, and for a time was played as a devotional rite in the Church of Lolth at Sshamath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In recent centuries sava&rsquo;s popularity amongst the nobility has waned, partly due to an increase in players drawn from the lower classes. Since all that is required to play sava well is a quick mind and a degree of study, many drow from the underclasses who were able to master the game became capable of defeating members of the noble houses. This intolerable state of affairs was notably remarked upon by the Archmage Gromph Baenre, who, when defeated in a sava match by a lowly footsoldier, calmly stated that;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;&hellip; to lose to you [at sava] does not make me the lesser drow. It does, however, make me very, very angry.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whereupon he transformed the unfortunate victor into a mushroom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of its universality, sava has become less common in the halls of the nobility, but this decrease in popularity is more than compensated for by its dissemination throughout the rest of drow society. There are even a few non-drow players in existence &ndash; the wizard Elminster is known to be a competent player &ndash; but few if any of these have ever sat across the table from a competent drow sava master. Partly this is due to the drow race&rsquo;s general reclusiveness, but mostly it&rsquo;s because the dark elves are fiercely protective of their traditional game and tend to flay and/or eviscerate members of any other species whom they find playing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, sava can be said to be fully entrenched in the culture of the drow, and no non-drow could ever hope to fully understand its subtler aspects. The game of sava forms a vital lynchpin in the world of the dark elves. Though they would never admit it, the fact that sava is available to all, rich and poor alike, makes it a unifying factor in an otherwise heavily stratified society. It has been said that the world of the drow is one of chaos, treachery and disorder &ndash; ironically, the game which codifies these concepts may well be part of the glue that holds that world together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></div><br> <br clear="all" /> </div> <div id="google-view-footer"> <div id="maybecanedit" style="float:right"><a class="google-small-link" id="editpermissionlink" href="https://docs.google.com/Doc?tab=edit&dr=true&id=dksbzwn_0fvchhthm" title="Edytuj tę stronę"> Edytuj tę stronę (jeśli masz uprawnienia)</a> <span style="color:#676767;">|</span> <input id="report-abuse-button" type="button" value="Zgłoś nadużycie" onclick="reportAbuse();"></div> <div style="float:left"> <a title="Więcej informacji o serwisie Dokumenty Google" class="google-small-link" href="https://docs.google.com/"> Dokumenty Google — edytowanie tekstu, arkuszy kalkulacyjnych i prezentacji w internecie.</a> </div> <p> &nbsp; </div> <script><!--
